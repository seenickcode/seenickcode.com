        Hi, my name is Nick. I've been a software engineering mentor, writer,
        software craftsman and entrepreneur for over 20 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for extra curricular projects, I've founded the largest
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/nycgolang" target="_blank"
          >Golang meetup</a
        >
        in the U.S. outside of Silicon Valley, as well as the
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/nycneo4j/" target="_blank">NYC Neo4j</a>
        meetup. My wife and I design and write mobile apps in our free time,
        such as
        <a href="https://steadycalendar.com" target="_blank">Steady Calendar</a>
        and <a href="http://brewswap.co" target="_blank">Brewswap</a>. I also
        <a href="https://medium.com/@seenickcode" target="_blank">write</a>
        about technology on a regular basis.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the past, I've held engineering, tech lead and consulting positions
        working with various Fortune 500 companies, including Adidas, Reebok,
        Benefit Cosmetics and TaylorMade.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2018, I've moved back to the U.S. after living abroad in Germany for
        two years. I currently live in NYC with my wife and son.
      </p>
